    "- **[Exercise 3: Multi-object IOU Tracker (Bounding-Box Tracker)](./src/hungarian_tracker.py)** : Tracking with Intersection over union with an optimized matching algorithm, called Hungarian Algorithm. It is a way for getting the highest matchings on a similarity matrix between tracks and detections.\n",

    "In this exercise we will extend the exercise 4 tracker by introducing a new criteria in similarity matrix. In previous exercises similarity matrix was based on position and size of bounding boxes, here we will introduce a computer vision feature. To do so we will use neural network by transforming boundingboxes into embeddings. Here are the step for computing similarity between 2 bounding boxes:\n",
